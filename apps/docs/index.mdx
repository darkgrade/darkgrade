<Warning>
  Darkgrade is currently in alpha and APIs may change frequently without backwards compatibility.
</Warning>

Darkgrade lets you programmatically control your camera from your application. Capture photos, adjust settings, stream live view, record video, and manage files—all with a simple, type-safe API. Whether you're building a photography app, automating studio workflows, or creating custom camera integrations, Link provides everything you need without the complexity of low-level protocols.
