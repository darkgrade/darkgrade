**Connect to & control your camera with TypeScript**

> **Note:** Fuse is in alpha and APIs may change without backwards compatibility.

This library is a comprehensive TypeScript implementation of [ISO-15740:2013](https://www.iso.org/standard/63602.html) which most camera manufacturers from the last 2 decades have used under the hood to accept commands and transmit information. It also contains a partial implementation of various vendor specifications. [`libgphoto2`](https://github.com/gphoto/libgphoto2) and its command line tool [`gphoto2`](https://github.com/gphoto/gphoto2) also use these libraries under the hood.
