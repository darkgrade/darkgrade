**PTP (Picture Transfer Protocol)** is a standardized protocol for transferring images and controlling digital cameras. Originally developed by the International Imaging Industry Association (I3A) and later standardized as **ISO 15740:2013**, PTP has become the foundation for camera communication across most major camera manufacturers.

## History and Standardization

PTP was first introduced in the early 2000s as a replacement for the proprietary protocols that camera manufacturers were using. The protocol was designed to:

- Provide a **standardized way** to communicate with digital cameras
- Enable **remote control** of camera settings and functions
- Facilitate **image transfer** from camera to computer
- Support **event-driven** communication for real-time updates

The protocol was standardized as **ISO 15740:2013**, which defines the core operations, properties, events, and data formats that cameras and host devices use to communicate.

## How PTP Works

PTP operates on a **request-response model** where a host device (like your computer) sends operations to the camera, and the camera responds with data or status information. The protocol defines several key components:

### Operations

Operations are commands sent from the host to the camera. Common operations include:

- **GetDeviceInfo** - Retrieve information about the camera
- **GetObject** - Download an image or file from the camera
- **GetProperty** - Read a camera setting (ISO, aperture, shutter speed, etc.)
- **SetProperty** - Change a camera setting
- **CaptureImage** - Trigger the camera to take a photo

### Properties

Properties represent camera settings and state. Standard PTP properties include:

- **ExposureIndex** (ISO)
- **FNumber** (Aperture)
- **ExposureTime** (Shutter Speed)
- **WhiteBalance**
- **FocusMode**

### Events

Events allow cameras to notify the host about changes without polling:

- **ObjectAdded** - A new image was captured
- **PropertyChanged** - A camera setting was modified
- **DevicePropChanged** - Device property was updated

### Data Formats

PTP defines standard data formats for transferring images and metadata:

- **JPEG** - Standard image format
- **RAW** - Unprocessed sensor data
- **ObjectInfo** - Metadata about stored images

## Vendor Extensions

While ISO 15740:2013 provides the foundation, most camera manufacturers extend PTP with **vendor-specific operations and properties** to support advanced features:

- **Sony** - Live view streaming, video recording, SDIO operations
- **Nikon** - Extended property definitions, advanced live view
- **Canon** - Remote control operations, event polling enhancements

These extensions allow manufacturers to support features beyond the base PTP specification while maintaining compatibility with the core protocol.

## Why PTP Matters

PTP has become the de facto standard for camera communication because:

1. **Universal Support** - Most digital cameras from the last two decades support PTP
2. **Standardized Interface** - Provides a consistent way to interact with cameras regardless of manufacturer
3. **Remote Control** - Enables programmatic control of camera settings and capture
4. **Event-Driven** - Supports real-time updates without constant polling
5. **Extensible** - Allows vendors to add proprietary features while maintaining compatibility

## PTP in Darkgrade Fuse

Darkgrade Fuse implements the ISO 15740:2013 specification along with vendor-specific extensions for Sony, Nikon, and Canon cameras. The library provides:

- **Type-safe** PTP operations and properties
- **Automatic vendor detection** and feature selection
- **High-level abstractions** for common camera operations
- **Direct access** to low-level PTP operations when needed

This allows you to work with PTP cameras using modern TypeScript while maintaining full access to the underlying protocol when needed.
